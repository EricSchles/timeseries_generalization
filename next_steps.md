Next Steps:

Eric's next steps:
 * Events for all previous years
 * 

* flask app 
	* pass map data to backend

* model demographic data - given the three variables we have (internet connectivity, poverty level, demographic information) - we will try to extrapolate from areas we have attendence levels and have held events to places we haven't held events in the past, to infer how well events would go in those areas.
	* We'll use mutlivariate linear regression for this, as a first model approximation.
